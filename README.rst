 txYoga
========

txYoga is a toolkit for writing RESTful web applications using Twisted_.

.. _Twisted: http://www.twistedmatrix.com/

You define a collection and some elements for that collection. txYoga gives
you a resource, which Twisted then lets you serve to clients.

This was originally written for internal use in a project, but I figured it
was generically useful, so I yanked it out. As a result, documentation is
probably pretty scarce for now. Sorry.

Where did the name from?
========================

The ``tx`` is a common prefix for Twisted community code. It's called yoga
because it's Twisted REST. Get it? Yes, ha ha ha I kill me.
