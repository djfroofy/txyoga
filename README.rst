``txyoga`` is a toolkit for writing RESTful web applications using Twisted_,
particularly ``twisted.web.server``.

.. _Twisted: http://www.twistedmatrix.com/

You write a collection. You write some elements for that
collection. ``txyoga`` worries about giving you a publishable ``IResource``.

This was originally written for internal use in a project, but I figured it
was generically useful, so I yanked it out. As a result, documentation is
probably pretty scarce for now.

Remember how I just apologized for a marked lack of documentation? Yeah,
that. Sorry.

Where did the name from?
========================

Twisted REST. Yoga. Get it?
